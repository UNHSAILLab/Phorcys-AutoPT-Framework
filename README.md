# Capstone-Penetration-Testing
Capstone project for using Reinforcement Learning to conduct intelligent penetration tests.

## Abstract (draft)

Weaknesses in an organizations network infrastructure are extremely common and pose an extreme risk. It was found that in 2020 the average cost of a data breach is $3.29 million. Because of this, the demand and importance of hiring penetration testers to assess security of an organizations network has skyrocketed. With the lack of cybersecurity professionals, many automated tools have been developed to allow organizations to test their infrastructure for loopholes without the expertise of a Penetration Tester. However, most uatomated tools cannot be fully relied upon to conduct penetration tests because they incapable of dynamic networks. In this project, produced is an intelligent agent that uses reinforcement learning to conduct dynamic penetration tests effectively and efficently. The purpose is to reduce the resources required, time, and cost of conducting proper security evaulation(s) of  a network.
